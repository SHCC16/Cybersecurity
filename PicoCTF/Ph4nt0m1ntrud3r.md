### Hints

1. Filter your packets to narrow down your search. 
2. Attacks were done in timely manner. 
3. Time is essential

### Solution

I opened the pcap file in Wireshark to test for anomalies and to see if there's something useful out of it, I came across multiple "===" signs in various packets which upon searching I found out that
they represent base 64 encoding, Then it was pretty much not difficult from there as i just sorted all the packets which had "===" with "time" as their filter and just decoded the texts in that order 
and I was able to obtain the flag.



Hence solved xd
